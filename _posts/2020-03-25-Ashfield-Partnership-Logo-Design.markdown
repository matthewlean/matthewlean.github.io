The Ashfield Partnership is a collaboration of partners sharing similar beliefs and values committed to realising the vision of The Ashfield Estate. The builders who make up the Partership are; CG Fry & Son Development, Morrish Homes and Wyatt Homes 

The website would play a key role in communicating the ideologies and values of the Partnership but more importantly the key information on the development of the plots, infrastructure created to support the new towns and events to enrich the communities created.

## Logo Design

One of the important aspects of the logos design was it's ability to work alongside the current Ashfield Estate logo. The logo would have to appeal to the modern building partnership but also fit alongside the Ashfield Estate logo.

## Website Design

The Ashfield website would be not only a home for the new Ashfield Partnership but be split and have a side for the Ashfield Estate.
