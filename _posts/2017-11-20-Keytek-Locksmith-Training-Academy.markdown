## Wordpress Theme Design Render

<div href="#" data-featherlight="{{ site.url }}/assets/site-post/locksmith-training-render.jpg" class="img" alt="eSports team raptors text logo"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/site-post/locksmith-training-render.jpg"></div>

The Keytek Locksmith Training Academy are a training provider for locksmith courses of various levels for the UK. They offer a wide range of courses and needed a site to showcase the course content, host blogposts and provide information to possible students.

The website for the academy needed remaking, with a modern design and a clean and simple wordpress theme which would have to be easily customizable and edited by the in-house digital marketing team. The site was built on the framework [Bulma](https://bulma.io) a lightweight CSS framework based on Flexbox. This modern and minimal framework was a good starting point, learning and [documentation](https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/) are available through the site and would allow the marketing team to learn more about coding and easily edit the theme when they needed to in the future.

A starting point for making the theme was with the template [Bulmapress](https://github.com/teamscops/bulmapress), a template using Bulma and [Underscores](http://underscores.me/).
