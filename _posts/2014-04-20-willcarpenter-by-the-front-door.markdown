## Will Carpenter – By The Front Door [Official Lyric Video]

By The Front Door is one of the songs Will released on his EP – Radio Blues. He asked me if I could create a handwritten lyric video to use for the song. I thought this would give me a good enough excuse to dig out my graphics tablet and took him up on it. After listening to the song a few times and getting a feel for it, I started doing some rough sketches of some of the scenes described in the lyrics.

<div href="#" data-featherlight="{{ site.url }}/assets/site-post/20171103-By-The-Front-Door-thumb.jpg" class="img" alt="By the front door"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/site-post/20171103-By-The-Front-Door-thumb.jpg"></div>

Will was pretty kind and said my pretty bad art style was fine and fitted the feel for the song. So I continued on, drawing scenes and getting a consistant look throughtout the whole video. After finishing with the drawing I moved onto the text, I wanted to make it feel animated which led me writing all the lines from the song 3 times and looping through these to give the text some motion. I also did this with the drawings, to keep again a consistant feel, and to give the video a more dynamic feel.
